# Flood-It

A game rendered played on a grid of cells, in which the user tries to make the board all one color.
The cell in the top left is considered flooded, and the user controls are clicking on other cells. All
flooded cells will become that color in a cascade effect, and any cells of the same color as the flooded cells
will also become flooded. The user has a certain number of turns to win the game. Board size, number of cell colors, and
number of turns to win in are all configurable.
